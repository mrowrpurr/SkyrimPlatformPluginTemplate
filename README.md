# Mrowr Purr's Skyrim Platform Plugin Template

#### Done

- Jest unit test setup
- All `.ts` files are included in the build

#### TODO

- Configuration option for Module vs Plugin
- Jest `printConsole` runner for integration tests
- Maybe include both a Module and a Plugin in the same repo to show how to make reusable code but also a plugin
